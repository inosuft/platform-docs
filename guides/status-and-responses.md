# ðŸ«“ Status & Responses

This explains the payload response and statuses returned by our API endpoints. These are commonly seen when consuming our endpoints. Note, these applies mostly on every endpoint.

#### General Response Structure

```javascript
{
    "error": false,
    "errors": [],
    "data": {},
    "message": "",
    "status": 200
}
```

The response data structure is exactly the same for every response on our API call. Find the description below

<table><thead><tr><th width="119">Property</th><th width="168">Data Type</th><th width="353">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>error</td><td>boolean</td><td>Indicates if there is an error on the response or not. This can either be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>errors</td><td>array of strings</td><td>This array contains strings of error descriptions if <code>error</code> above is true</td><td>["error"]</td></tr><tr><td>data</td><td>object or array</td><td>This contains response data as an object or an array</td><td>{ name: "to" }</td></tr><tr><td>message</td><td>string</td><td>The response message</td><td>"successful"</td></tr><tr><td>status</td><td>number</td><td>The response status code</td><td>200</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Pagination Data response

When API requests are made to retrieve a list of data ( ex. a list of banks ), the response comes with pagination information that can help you navigate the list. Below is an example of a response when a list of banks is requested.

```javascript
{
    "error": false,
    "errors": [],
    "count": 1,
    "total": 533,
    "pagination": {
        "next": {
            "page": 3,
            "limit": 1
        },
        "prev": {
            "page": 1,
            "limit": 1
        }
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "name": "Polaris Bank",
            "code": "076",
            "country": "nigeria",
            "currency": "NGN",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "type": "nuban",
            "createdAt": "2024-01-20T09:21:39.261Z",
            "updatedAt": "2024-01-20T09:21:39.261Z"
        }
    ],
    "message": "successful",
