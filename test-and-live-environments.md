# Test & Live Environments

The Vacepay API accommodates both Live and Test environments. It is crucial to understand that the TEST environment is exclusively meant for testing purposes and utilizes simulated data, whereas the LIVE environment facilitates real integrations and operational data.\
\
Accounts created in the TEST environment are not compatible with the LIVE environment due to the distinct nature of these environments. Consequently, you will encounter variations in business IDs, API keys, and other relevant identifiers.

#### Below, you will find the Base URLs for the API environments we support:

Test Environment URL:  [https://sandbox.vacepay.com](https://sandbox.vacepay.com)\
Live Environment URL:  [https://api.vacepay.com](https://api.vacepay.com)
